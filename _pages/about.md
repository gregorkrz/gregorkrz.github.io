Welcome to my page 👋

I am an incoming PhD student at Stanford University. Previously, I have completed my MSc in Physics at ETH Zürich 🇨🇭 (2025) and BSc in Physics at the University of Ljubljana 🇸🇮 (2023).

My research interests include machine learning, future colliders and searches for Physics beyond the Standard Model - and I get especially excited when these fields overlap!
